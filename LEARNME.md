# 📘 Learn: Beginner's Guide to Blockchain Voting System

Welcome! This file helps **new developers** or **non-blockchain users** understand how the project works and how to run it step by step.

---

## 🧾 What Is This Project?

This is a **Blockchain Voting System** that uses **Ethereum smart contracts** to make elections:
- Transparent 🪪
- Secure 🛡️
- Decentralized 🌐

Once a vote is cast, it **cannot be changed or tampered with**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Area         | Tool/Tech               |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Smart Contract | Solidity               |
| Blockchain    | Ethereum (Ganache/Testnet) |
| Frontend      | React + TypeScript     |
| Wallet        | MetaMask               |
| Styling       | Tailwind CSS           |

## 🛠️ How to Use This Project (Step-by-Step)

### Prerequisites:
- Install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**
- Install **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**
- Install **Ganache** for local blockchain (optional)
- Install **Git** if not already installed

---

### 🚀 Run the Project Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/himatejachowdary/Blockchain-Voting-System.git
cd Blockchain-Voting-System

npm install
npm run dev
Make sure MetaMask is set to the same network (Localhost 8545 if using Ganache).

💡 What Happens Under the Hood?
1.User connects wallet (MetaMask)

2.Smart contract is deployed (via Truffle/Hardhat)

3.Admin creates an election

4.Voters submit votes via frontend

5.Votes are stored on Ethereum (permanently)

6.Tallying is done automatically via contract functions


🔗 Smart Contract Concepts
Immutable: Cannot be changed after deployment

Decentralized: No central admin can cheat

Self-executing: No backend server required to count or store votes

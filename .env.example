###  1. What Youâ€™re Adding:
A sample .env.example file that lists the environment variables required by your frontend (like contract address, Infura URL, etc.).

###2. When Do You Need This?
If your code uses variables like:   process.env.VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
or anything starting with VITE_, they are loaded from .env files. You should not push your real .env file, but share a .env.example file instead.

### 3.  3. Instructions:
 1. In your project folder, create a file:  .env.example

2. Paste the following (adjust keys if needed):
# Ethereum Smart Contract Address
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Optional: Infura or Alchemy endpoint (if using)
VITE_INFURA_API=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-api-key

# Set to true if using testnet
VITE_USE_TESTNET=true

# Chain ID for Ganache (e.g., 1337) or testnet (e.g., 5 for Goerli)
VITE_CHAIN_ID=1337

ðŸ”’ Don't commit your actual .env file! Add this line to your .gitignore if it's not there: .env

###  4. Save & Push to GitHub
git add .env.example
git commit -m "Add .env.example for environment setup"
git push origin main


âœ… Now anyone who clones your repo knows what variables they need to run your app locally!
